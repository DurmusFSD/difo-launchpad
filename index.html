            Difo Launchpad will ensure the token price to be above the IDO or

            distribution to all of its investors is completed. If the target
            price is not met, the locked tokens below the IDO price on the day
            of unlocking will be repurchased by Difo Launchpad in USDT, USDC, or
            BUSD equal to the sale price.

            In the event of project failures, or any unforeseen events that may
            leave investors at risk, an authorization plan will go into force.
            Difo Launchpad will begin to protect the investors' principal only
            in cases where the project has a violation in its operation or fails
            to meet its objectives. The plan will come into effect if any such
            adverse situations arise.
